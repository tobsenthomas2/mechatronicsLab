The Program should lead to a dimming LED controlled by a STM32 and written in micropython. 
The LED will be from off to on in 5 secudes and the brighntes will increase every 0.05 secundes

In this two-week exercise, you will write code which runs a motor and measures 
where it is, and then youâ€™ll encapsulate that code in Python classes. You will get
practice documenting code with Doxygen, testing your code thoroughly to ensure that
it is reliable, and managing source code files using Git.
